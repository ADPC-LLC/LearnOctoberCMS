# LearnOctoberCMS

Learning to use October CMS via the course by Ivan Dorić
Note that October CMS, although OSS, is still licenced software and to use thier CMS in any public domain requires a licence from them. You can find thier repository here: https://github.com/octobercms

I would like to give a lot of credit to Ivan Dorić for showing how October CMS can be applied in conjunction with powerful cross-platform tools in order to develop powerful content management systems based on the Laravel framework. Thanks Ivan.

The idea behind this repository is to use it as a learning tool to not only learn how October CMS can be leveraged with tools like WebPack, but also to improve the expereince of developing and deploying such a CMS using tools like Git, Github, Laravel and the foundation ecosystems used in typical webdevelopment like Node.JS, Ajax, HTML5, CSS, JS, Tailwind CSS and others.
