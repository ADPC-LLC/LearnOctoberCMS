<p>
  This is the locally hosted version of the "<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
    >LearnOctoberCMS</a
  >" version of October CMS. It is a modified October CMS demo theme that
  explores the core features of the CMS and goes beyond by incorporating tools
  like Webpack. By default, October CMS uses flat file themes where each theme
  is a set of files. Each page has a corresponding file that you can edit with
  your favourite code editor and manage with your favourite Version Control
  System. You will find added files and added assets used by this modified
  October Demonstration theme in the themes/demo/ and /extras directories
  respectively.
